# QR-Smart-Hostel-Attendance
QR based recognition system for marking and keeping track of Hostel Attendance 

For Warden's side:
Open the index page and you can see a scan option there which on clicking opens a real time scanner.
You can then scan any QR code generated by the student's interface.
Once you have successfully scanned the QR, the details of the student, along with their photo will be displayed, so that the warden can verify if the face of the student matches with his/her photo or not.
The warden can thereby mark the student present.

For Student's side:
Open the login page and enter your login credentials.
After successful login, a unique QR will be generated on the student's interface.
The student will then show his/her QR to the warden so that they can scan it.
A student can also register or unregister themselves.
